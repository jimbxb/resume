\section{Summary}

\begin{flushleft}
I am a graduate of the degree of Master of Computer Science and Bachelor of Science at 
The University of Melbourne with a vast array of experience in academic teaching. 
My research project in the Master of Computer Science degree related to the design and implementation 
of a higher-order extension to a programming language, Wybe, and features various novel compiler optimisations.
This research degree and my studies developed my passion for compilers and code optimisation.

\section{Projects}

\entry{Higher-Order Programming in Wybe --- Master's Research Project}
{2021 -- 2022}
{
    Postgraduate degree research project, developing a higher-order extension to a novel programming language, Wybe.
    This required the development of novel syntactic constructs, low-level code generation, and novel optimisation methods.
    The language also features novel features, such as resources (a declarative alternative to global variables), which 
    required consideration in the design and optimisation of higher-order code.

    The result of this year of work was a thesis detailing my research in the development of this extension, and 
    benchmark results for the language's performance with the use of the novel optimisations. This thesis can be found on my GitHub.
